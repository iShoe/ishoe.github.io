* Developed a RAFT-based distributed consensus algorithm in Golang for replicating log entries among a group of nodes to ensure fault-tolerance. 
* Implemented heartbeat mechanisms, triggering leader election, vote requests and appending log entries in the distributed system. 
* Utilized backtracking to resolve any log conflicts detected between leader and a follower.
